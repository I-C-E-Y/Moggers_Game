# Game launcher

A simple game launcher for developers to showcase their games. Especially useful during gaming conventions for example. 

*⚠ It's not aimed as being shipped with your game on Steam or other platforms.*

## How to add games

1. If not present, create a folder called **games** next to the executable.
2. Inside, create a folder for each game you want. The name of the folder will be the name of the game.
3. Place your executable, capsule image, background image and description.txt
4. The game executable will be launched by the launcher
5. The capsule must be named **capsule** with the following extensions supported: jpg, jpeg, png
6. The background image bust be named **bg** with the following extensions supported: jpg, jpeg, png
7. In **description.txt**, put the description you want to see below your game capsule in the launcher

Here's an example folder  
game_launcher.exe  
├── games  
│   ├── Game name  
│   │   ├── game_executable.exe  
│   │   ├── capsule.jpg  
│   │   └── bg.jpg  

You can also check the **Fake** folder to see a game example

## How to navigate

Navigate using keyboard or gamepad using the usual keys used for navigation (arrows keys, enter).

`alt+enter` to toggle fullscreen

## Limitations

Right now, the launcher is only working with windows. Supporting linux and mac shouldn't be complicated, we just need to detect the correct extensions or file types. 

## Development

For development, you can use the **games** folder present in the project using the same configuration as explained above.
